# Distributed Computing and Web Services Assignments

This repository contains four assignments developed for the Distributed Computing and Web Services coursework. Each project demonstrates different aspects of distributed systems, web services, and client-server architecture using .NET, ASP.NET Core, SQLite, and Python integration.

## Assignments Overview

### 1. Online Gaming Lobby for Mortal Kombat X  
A .NET WCF and WPF-based multiplayer gaming lobby system enabling players to create and join chat rooms, exchange messages, private chat, and share files in real-time.

### 2. Bank Data Web Service (ASP.NET MVC Core + SQLite)  
A RESTful web service managing bank accounts, transactions, and user profiles with SQLite as the database backend. Includes data seeding, API validation, and error handling.

### 3. Bank Data Web Application (ASP.NET Core MVC)  
A two-tier web application with a user-friendly frontend interfacing with the bank data web service. Features user and admin dashboards for account management, transaction history, money transfers, and security controls.

### 4. Peer-to-Peer Job Execution System  
A hybrid peer-to-peer system combining an ASP.NET MVC web service, a .NET Remoting desktop client executing Python jobs via IronPython, and an ASP.NET Core dashboard for monitoring clients and job statuses. Includes multithreading, data integrity checks, and client health management.
